# Password-Manager
Simple password manager capable of generating and storing encrypted passwords
___

This is a small project of mine. It is capable of generating passwords, and encrypting them by using a key file, combined with a master password. You can also decrypt them if you have aftermentioned key file and master password.

I've added three example files into password directory. They show posibilities of this program. You can decrypt them by using key file provided with the rest of the code and password: "password".

I've also provided a key generator, so if you want to use a different key, you can generate a new one.

I wouldn't recommend using it to store your passwords, because there are many better and safer options out there, but it was a cool project nothantheless.
